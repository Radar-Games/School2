James Jenour the school kingpin is in charge of selling all the tests and cheat assignments in the school when he finds out Lachlan Duddy has been poaching his clients.

James Jenour is a brilliant kid kid with an amazing mind. He never hands in tests late, never fails in his tests and is an intensive listener. He buys teachers chocolate for their birthday and every holiday, in other words a teachers dream student. But thats not how the students see him, the student see him as one of the schools head honchos. He sells tests to struggling students for money and never lets someone tell him what to do. He started his day just as usual but then when he gets to school he hears a rumour from one of his minions “Someone else is selling test James”
